<h2>Project brief</h2> 
This project belongs to a final subject submission in design from Noroff where I was tasked to creating a style guide (brand guidelines) for a fictional winter sports club website. In this assignment, I challenged myself to create a visual identity for this fictive winter sports club, in addition to creating a design manual for design standards and regulations for the design of future website of it.
